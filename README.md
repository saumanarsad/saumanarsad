# üëã Hello, I'm Sauman Arshad!

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer passionate about creating impactful software solutions. Currently, I work at **Dubizzle Labs** as a Software Engineer, where I primarily use **Laravel** to build scalable web applications

## üöÄ What I Do

At Dubizzle Labs, my role involves architecting backend systems, optimizing database interactions, and ensuring seamless integration with frontend services. Recently, I've been diving deep into **Filament PHP**, and also opened a [public issue](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/issues/13598) in its repository to contribute to its improvement.
